    "##### Question 00\n",
    "What is a Large Language Model (LLM)? How is it different from traditional software?\n",
    "- **Answer:** An LLM is basically a machine learning AI that learns to understand, generate, and process the way humans speak. A traditional software already has prewitten intstructions which it follows those.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 01\n",
    "What does it mean to \"prompt\" an LLM? Why is prompting important?\n",
    "- **Answer:** A prompt in an LLM is a set of instructions that is inputted to the model, and gives an output based on the user response. Prompting is important because it's the primary instructions that influence the content and style. It also trys it's best for accuaracy to give the user the best possible results.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 02\n",
    "Research \"prompt engineering.\" What are some techniques for getting better responses from LLMs?\n",
    "- **Answer:** Prompt engineering is a process of redesigning instructions to guide LLMs to produce a specific, and accurate outputs. Some techniques for getting better responses from LLms are being specific, asking the LLM to \"make no mistakes\", and also breaking down complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 03\n",
    "What are some ethical concerns with customizing AI behavior?\n",
    "- **Answer:** Some ethical concerns with customizing AI behavior is that it can cause biases in their training data. Another huge concern is discrimination because AI would favor or disadvantage certain groups of people, and that can lead to job denials or misdiagnoses."

    "Why do we use `{question}` as a placeholder instead of writing a specific question?\n",
    "- **Answer:** We use questions as a placeholder instead of writing a specific question because we need to increase the LLM's flexibility. This helps the AI make sure when given different scenarios, it is able to answer differently each time."

    "- **Answer:** We need to pass a dictionary instead of just a string because we need to pass multiple things with a value, in an organized matter. AI requires more than one single piece of information, which a string wouldn't be right because it would only display a single piece of information rather than an abundance of information. If AI is receiving more infomration, it's going to need to process more.\n",

    "##### Question 22\n",
    "Did ChefBot follow the system prompt instructions? Give specific examples from the responses.\n",
    "- **Answer:** Chefbot followed the system prompt exceptionally. Firstly, he was able to provide a beginner-friendly meal for the user. Then as the user asked follow up questions it was able to give side dishes, and reccomend a dessert that compliments the meal well. It didn't use emojis so much so it focused on that prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 23\n",
    "Try asking ChefBot a non-cooking question (modify the code above). How does it respond?\n",
    "- **Answer:**  A non-cooking question had some issues because the AI was taking too long to generate a answer for the president of the United States. It performs well when it is cooking related questions rather than non-related material. The AI doesn't know the answer and insead of providing a viable answer it restated the question as the \"answer\". "

      "1. Start with a high-quality flour: use whole wheat or whole grain flour for a stronger texture and flavor.\n",
      "2. Use a low water content: water is the key to creating a crumbly and flaky crust.\n",
      "3. Proof the dough at a slightly lower temperature: lower the oven temperature and proof the dough for longer to achieve a chewy texture.\n",
      "4. Let the dough rest: resting the dough before baking allows the dough to expand and get the right amount of air.\n",

      "2. Use a plastic bag: place the plastic bag over the dough to keep it in a moist environment.\n",
      "3. Don't open the bag: do not touch the plastic bag or open it, as it can cause the dough to rise faster and become stale faster.\n",
