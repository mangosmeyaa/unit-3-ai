    "##### Question 00\n",
    "What is a Large Language Model (LLM)? How is it different from traditional software?\n",
    "- **Answer:** An LLM is basically a machine learning AI that learns to understand, generate, and process the way humans speak. A traditional software already has prewitten intstructions which it follows those.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 01\n",
    "What does it mean to \"prompt\" an LLM? Why is prompting important?\n",
    "- **Answer:** A prompt in an LLM is a set of instructions that is inputted to the model, and gives an output based on the user response. Prompting is important because it's the primary instructions that influence the content and style. It also trys it's best for accuaracy to give the user the best possible results.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 02\n",
    "Research \"prompt engineering.\" What are some techniques for getting better responses from LLMs?\n",
    "- **Answer:** Prompt engineering is a process of redesigning instructions to guide LLMs to produce a specific, and accurate outputs. Some techniques for getting better responses from LLms are being specific, asking the LLM to \"make no mistakes\", and also breaking down complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 03\n",
    "What are some ethical concerns with customizing AI behavior?\n",
    "- **Answer:** Some ethical concerns with customizing AI behavior is that it can cause biases in their training data. Another huge concern is discrimination because AI would favor or disadvantage certain groups of people, and that can lead to job denials or misdiagnoses."

      "Human: How do I know when pasta is done?\n",
      "ChefBot: Different types of pasta require different cooking times. For example, spaghetti takes less time than linguine. Here's a quick guide to help you determine when your pasta is done:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Test for al dente:\n",
      "  - Test your pasta with a fork or your fingers. It should be slightly firm but not too hard.\n",
      "  - If fibrous pasta like spaghetti is hard, cook it further.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Shake your bowl:\n",
      "  - If the pasta is still sticky, it's still cooking.\n",
      "  - If the pasta is too dry, add a little bit of water or broth.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Test for pliability:\n",
      "  - Use a fork to gently press down the center of the pasta. If it doesn't spring back, it's done.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Look at the surface for any signs of raw meat:\n",
      "  - If you see an uneven texture, it's still cooking.\n",
      "  - If you see any bubbles or discoloration, it's done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, cooking pasta requires a lot of attention to detail, so take your time and enjoy the process!\n"

    "##### Question 20\n",
    "When calling `invoke()` on a chain, why do we pass a dictionary `{\"question\": \"...\"}` instead of just a string?\n",
    "- **Answer:** We need to pass a dictionary instead of just a string because we need to pass multiple things with a value, in an organized matter. AI requires more than one single piece of information, which a string wouldn't be right because it would only display a single piece of information rather than an abundance of information. If AI is receiving more infomration, it's going to need to process more.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 21\n",
    "What would happen if we passed `{\"query\": \"...\"}` instead of `{\"question\": \"...\"}`?\n",
    "- **Answer:** If we passed query instead of question, I think it's the same thing as asking a question. Both of these words are terms for the input prompt that is provided to the model. These words can be also used interchangeably to describe the way in which a user interacts with an AI."

    "Did ChefBot follow the system prompt instructions? Give specific examples from the responses.\n",
    "- **Answer:** Chefbot followed the system prompt exceptionally. Firstly, he was able to provide a beginner-friendly meal for the user. Then as the user asked follow up questions it was able to give side dishes, and reccomend a dessert that compliments the meal well. It didn't use emojis so much so it focused on that prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 23\n",
    "Try asking ChefBot a non-cooking question (modify the code above). How does it respond?\n",
    "- **Answer:**  A non-cooking question had some issues because the AI was taking too long to generate a answer for the president of the United States. It performs well when it is cooking related questions rather than non-related material. The AI doesn't know the answer and insead of providing a viable answer it restated the question as the \"answer\". "

If it tries to answer something outside of what it was trained on in terms of the data then it will start to gaslight us. We don't want it to give any false information, which is why we prompt the AI with the information that it needed and so that it is accurate."

It wasn't able to say it doesn't have information on questions and instead gave the student false information.

    "Why is it important for AI assistants to admit when they don't know something?\n",
    "- **Answer:**  It is important for AI assistants to admit when they don't know something because it can build trust with users by telling the truth about their lack of knowledge for certain questions. Claiming to have fake knowledge leads to misinformation, which causes mistakes or confusion. Admitting uncertainty encourages users to make sure information is coming from a reputable source. "

    "Which chain did you use for interactive mode? Why?\n",
    "- **Answer:** The chain that I used for interactive mode was the cooking one, because I felt like it was the most accurate one out of every chain I've tested in this lab. I also love cooking, so I wanted to see different ways of making my favorite foods aswell. I wanted it to come up with ideas I didn't think were possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 38\n",
    "Have a conversation (5+ exchanges). Does the AI maintain its persona throughout?\n",
    "- **Answer:** I had a conversation with the AI about the recipes of :eggs, pancakes, bacon, french fries, and mac and cheese. It maintained a well formatted and detailed recipe and clear steps to making these meals. It kept the same persona throughout the entirety of our conversation. There were some times where it would take the food and include it in a whole other dish which was confusing. But in terms for the reliable, I'd say chefbot was really cooking up with his answers and responses torwards my questions."

    "##### Question 39\n",
    "Explain what each of these LangChain components does in your own words:\n",
    "- `PromptTemplate()`: Prompt templates are used for making reusable text for the prompts you sent to an LLM. It serves as a placeholder for variables that will change after each use.\n",
    "- `ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages()`: This lets me build a prompt specifically for chat-based AI's by combining multiple message types like system, and user into one big prompt.\n",
    "- `invoke()`: This function calls out to send the prompt to the LLM to get the output. It just invokes the AI to generate responses based on the questions asked.\n",
    "- The pipe operator `|`: This is used to chain componenets together, so the output of one component automatically becomes the input for the next, creating this sort of chain reaction between questions and responses. This ensures that if it's a related question, it is followed up and remembered.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 40\n",
    "What is the difference between training a model and customizing it with prompts?\n",
    "- **Answer:** A training model just means to teach it from scratch or updating certain thnigs using a dataset, so it learns new knowledge or skills. Customizing with prompts, on the other hand, it doesn't directly change the model it guides the models responses by giving it specific instructions or context in the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 41\n",
    "Compare these two customization techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "System prompts: It gives the model high level instructions about its behavior or role before any user input. Users should uae it when you want to guide the overall style, tone, or rules the model should follow throughout a conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge injection: Knowledge injection is when you give the model extra information in the prompt. This helps the model give correct answers. It is helpful for topics the model might not already know.\n"

    "##### Question 42\n",
    "You learned to make an AI that only responds based on provided knowledge. Why is this important for real-world applications?\n",
    "- **Answer:** It is important because it makes the AI give accurate and trustworthy answers. This prevents it from making up information. Real world applications often need reliable facts, like in healthcare or finance. Using only provided knowledge helps the AI to avoid mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 43\n",
    "What could go wrong if someone used these techniques to create a misleading AI assistant?\n",
    "- **Answer:** The AI could give false or biased information. This leads people to trust it and make wrong decisions. It could spread rumors or misinformation. This can cause harm or confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 44\n",
    "Should companies be required to disclose how they've customized their AI assistants? Defend your position.\n",
    "- **Answer:** Yes, companies should tell users how their AI is customized. This helps people know if the AI might be biased or limited. Transparency builds trust within users. It also allows people to make informed choices about using the AI."
